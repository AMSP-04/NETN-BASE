# NETN-BASE
The NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Base Datatypes (BASE) Module provides standard definitions of datatypes and extends the RPR-BASE FOM Module.

This module is a base module for all other NETN-FOM modules. It specifies standard data types and structures and extends the RPR-BASE module. The specification is based on IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) Object Model Template (OMT) and is primarily intended to support interoperability in a federated simulation (federation) based on HLA. An HLA-based Federation Object Model (FOM) is used to specify types of data and their encoding on the network. The NETN-BASE FOM module is available as an XML file for use in HLA-based federations.

## Versions, updates and extensions

All updates and versioning of this work are coordinated by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Coordination Office (MSCO), managed by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG) and performed as NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) technical activities in support of the NMSG Modelling and Simulation Standards Subgroup (MS3).

Feedback on the use of this work, suggestions for improvements and identified issues are welcome and can be provided using GitHub issue tracking. To engage in the development and update of this FOM Module please contact your national NMSG representative.

Version numbering of this FOM Module and associated documentation is based on the following principles:

* A new official version number is in effect only when a new release is made in the Master branch.
* An update of the major version number is made if the change constitutes a major restructuring, merging, addition or redefinition of semantics that breaks backward compatibility or covers entirely new concepts.
* An update of the minor version number is made if the change constitutes minor additions to existing concepts and editorial changes that do not break backward compatibility but may require updates of software to use new concepts.
* Patches are released to fix minor issues that do not break backward compatibility.
