The NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Base Datatypes (BASE) Module provides standard definitions of datatypes and extends the RPR-BASE FOM Module.

This module is a base module for all other NETN-FOM modules. It specifies standard data types and structures and extends the RPR-BASE module. The specification is based on IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) Object Model Template (OMT) and supports interoperability in a federated simulation (federation) based on HLA. An HLA-based Federation Object Model (FOM) is used to specify types of data and their encoding on the network.


## Overview

## Unique Identification

In HLA, the RTI uses a handle of the data type `ObjectInstanceHandle` to identify instances in `RTIambassador` and `FederateAmbassador` services. Every object instance in a federation execution receives a unique handle when it is registered. The object instance has a unique name, either specified by the registering federate or generated by the RTI. The instance handle does not persist between different federation executions or if an object is removed and then re-registered. The instance name is unique in a federation execution but, if generated by the RTI, it is not guaranteed to remain the same between federation executions. An object instance name can also be provided by the federate by first reserving the name and then using it when registering the object instance. Re-registering using the same name is not allowed. Therefore, object instances with auto-generated handles and names get new values if their owning federate leaves and later re-joins a federation execution.

The RPR-FOM use the `BaseEntity` attribute `EntityIdentifier` for unique entity identification. Some RPR-FOM interactions use the object instance name to reference an object instance. The `EntityIdentifier` is a triple consisting of `SiteID`, `ApplicationID` and `EntityNumber`, where site and application identify the federate registering the object and is responsible for updates of the RPR-FOM entity state attributes. The entity number is generated by the federate registering the object and is unique among all objects registered by the same federate. In addition, the `PhysicalEntity` attribute `Marking` and `AggregateEntity` attribute `AggregateMarking` are sometimes used to identify instances in a federation execution by name. However, these attributes are not intended to uniquely identify entities and are limited-length strings.

The NETN-BASE FOM module defines the `HLAobjectRoot` attribute `UniqueId` as a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) based on ISO/IEC 11578:1996 (and ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005). This attribute extends all objects using NETN-BASE and allows federates to assign a UUID which can persist between federation executions if required. The UUID consists of an array with 16 bytes and has a standardized printable format that consists of 32 ASCII characters (0-9, a-f) and four hyphens on predetermined places, e.g. 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000. The same format is used in the MSDL standard.

In the NATO FOM modules, references to objects use the UUID datatype and relies on federates to resolve references to object with the referenced `UniqueId`.

Similarly, the NETN-BASE defines the `HLAinteractionRoot` parameter `UniqueId`. The primary purpose of this parameter is to allow other subsequent interactions, e.g. acknowledgements, to reference a previously sent interaction.

## Federate Application

The NETN-BASE FOM module defines the `HLAobjectRoot` attribute `FederateApplication` which allows the association of an object with a federate application based on pre-agreed UUID. Federation agreements include a list of all participating federate applications and each federate is configured with its UUID. The `FederateApplication` attribute is used to reference the federate application with the main responsibility for the object. Normally, the federate registering the object have the main responsible for the object, but in some cases, some other federate may create the object and then divest ownership for some or all attributes. In these cases, the `FederateApplication` attribute can act as a trigger for the referenced federate application to take attribute ownership and assume its modelling responsibility.

Similarly, the NETN-BASE defines the optional `HLAinteractionRoot` parameter `FederateApplication`. The primary purpose of this parameter is to tag all interactions with a reference to the federate application sending the interaction. This allows better logging of interactions for analysis and debugging.

## Scenario Time

Logical time (or Simulation Time) is used to coordinate the exchange of data in a distributed simulation. HLA time management services can control the advancement of logical time. Advancement of logical time can be paced to wall-clock time for real-time or scaled real-time simulation or it can be unconstrained by wall-clock and run as fast as possibile. The RPR-FOM handles synchronization by timestamping each update and relying on synchronized system clocks to determine the advancing of time. Logical time representation and the methods for synchronizing the advancing of time in a distributed simulation can vary between different federations. 

Scenario time is the time displayed to simulation operators working with the actual scenario. Scenario time can be linked to the pace of logical time advancement but is an independent representation. E.g., during simulation, the logical time is strictly increasing (much like wall-clock time) and can never move backwards. However, scenario time may move forwards, backwards, or jump in time. 

The NETN-BASE FOM module defines the optional `HLAobjectRoot` attribute `Time` which allows objects to be timestamped with the time of creation using scenario time. Similarly, the NETN-BASE defines the optional `HLAinteractionRoot` parameter `Time` which represents the time in the scenario a specific interaction is sent.
